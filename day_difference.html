<p>The following graphs show the number of days between the target Sentinel-2 tile and the latest (closest in time) clear historical tile from the same place. A <b>target tile</b> is a 
512x512px area cropped from the full Sentinel-2 product. Every Sentinel-2 product from July to November was cropped into target tiles. It is not 
distinguished whether the target tile itself is cloudy or clear. A clear tile is a 512x512px tile from April to November, which does not contain clouds, semitransparent clouds or cloud shadows.<br><br>
All the Sentinel-2 products from April to November from a given year were downloaded, predicted with kappamask and cropped into tiles. The pipeline and cloud prediction were
  fully automatic. <br><br>The left and right panel of each image contain the same information, but the right one shows the accumulated view.

<p>The above data was put together from three locations - one in Estonia, one in Latvia and one in Poland.
<h2>Results for T35VME (Estonia):</h2>

<h2>Results for T34UED (Poland)</h2>
<p>This parameter is the maximum wind gust at the specified time, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth. The WMO defines a wind gust as the maximum of the wind averaged over 3 second intervals. This duration is shorter than a model time step, and so the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) deduces the magnitude of a gust within each time step from the time-step-averaged surface stress, surface friction, wind shear and stability. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.</p>

<p>The data also included two years - 2020 and 2018, which showed different results. However, only about half of 2018 products were found in creo, so it may give skewed 
  image. I want to add 2019 also for comparison, this should be ready in few days.</p>

<p>And finally, the results are expectedly different for different months:</p>
